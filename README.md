### Technical Details
This project uses [Facebook's Flow framework](https://flowtype.org/) so you'll need some way to [run Flow code](https://flowtype.org/docs/running.html#_).
I'm using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for this project, but [flow-remove-types](https://github.com/leebyron/flow-remove-types) is also an option.
